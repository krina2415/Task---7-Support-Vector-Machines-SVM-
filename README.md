# Task---7-Support-Vector-Machines-SVM-
SVM-based classifier using scikit-learn on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset with hyperparameter tuning and visualization.

# SVM Breast Cancer Classifier

This project uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with linear and RBF kernels to classify tumors as benign or malignant based on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

## Key Features

- Data preprocessing with scaling
- SVM classification using both linear and RBF kernels
- Visualization of 2D decision boundaries
- Tune hyperparameters like C and gamma
- Model evaluation with cross-validation
